# Smart Home Automation System

A Smart Home Automation System using IoT technologies.

## Overview

This project implements a Smart Home Automation System that allows users to control and automate various smart devices in their home. The system utilizes Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to connect and communicate with the devices, providing remote control and intelligent automation capabilities.

The system architecture consists of several components:

- **main.py**: The main entry point of the project that initializes and runs the automation system.
- **device.py**: Contains the Device class representing a smart device with properties and methods for controlling the device.
- **sensor.py**: Implements sensor classes (e.g., temperature, humidity, motion) with methods for reading data from sensors.
- **actuator.py**: Defines actuator classes (e.g., light, thermostat, door lock) with methods for controlling the corresponding devices.
- **scheduler.py**: Manages scheduled tasks for automating device actions based on time, sensor readings, or user-defined rules.
- **network.py**: Implements network communication functionalities for connecting devices and receiving commands.
- **database.py**: Provides database functionality for storing device data, user preferences, and system logs.
- **user_interface.py**: Contains a user interface module for interacting with the automation system through a command-line interface or web interface.
- **logging.py**: Implements logging functionalities for recording system events, device actions, and errors.
- **tests.py**: Includes unit tests for different modules and components of the system to ensure code quality and functionality.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Smart Home Automation System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/STUPIDZY/smart-home-automation.git`
2. Install the required dependencies (if any) mentioned in the project documentation.
3. Modify the code and configuration files to suit your specific requirements.
4. Run the main.py file to start the automation system: `python main.py`.

## Usage

The Smart Home Automation System provides the following functionalities:

- Control individual devices: You can control each smart device individually using the provided commands and methods.
- Automation: You can set up scheduled tasks and automation rules to automate device actions based on time, sensor readings, or user-defined conditions.
- User Interface: The system provides a user interface module (command-line or web interface) for interacting with the automation system and issuing commands.
- Logging: The system logs events, device actions, and errors for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.
